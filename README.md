# Tweets Classification
Classification of tweets (offensive or not offensive) for TP2 of the Artificial Intelligence course (IFT3335) by Philippe Schoeb and Nathan Bussière.

We have used several preprocessing methods and models to compare their results in a small analysis (written in french) that can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wspmybbwhgxd#bc7dba).

Some of the code in this repository (mostly in the preprocessing file) comes from an open source project.
